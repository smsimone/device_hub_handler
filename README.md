# Device Hub Handler

This project aims to handle a hub where are connected multiple devices (both Android and iOS).

## Goals

Currently the aim of the project is to handle the installation of an android app on multiple devices all connected to the same machine
but I also aim to run integrations tests using [maestro](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro)
